# Project Management Tool

This is an open source project management tool that allow hierarchical activities.

## Backlog

- [ ] Separate leaf tasks from composed tasks
    - [ ] A leaf task should be automatically transformed in a composed task when a subtask is created.
    - [ ] Attributes from composed tasks should be derived from leaf tasks.
    - [ ] Only leaf tasks should be shown in the activity list.
- [ ] Improve visualization of tasks as a list 
    - [ ] Search, filter and sort by all atributes.
    - [ ] Current scheduling strategy: closest deadline first.
    - [ ] Scheduling strategy: Critical first.
    - [ ] Scheduling strategy: Quicks/Easies first.
    - [ ] Scheduling strategy: Funs first.
    - [ ] Creation of custom scheduling for advanced users
- [ ] Notifications of deadlines, changes in activities, etc.- [ ] Multitask operations (delete, etc.)
- [ ] Add a nice search tool for tasks, users, tags, etc.
- [ ] Compute critical tasks based on dependencies and duration.
- [ ] Compute the predicted date to finish the project in the best and worst case scenarios considering the current status of tasks.
- [ ] Make stuff pretty
- [ ] Add task dependencies
- [ ] Add gant chart visualization
- [ ] Activity/Project progress bar
- [ ] Assigning users to tasks
- [ ] Add interested users to tasks (besides the main responsible for executing the task)
- [ ] Send remainder e-mails
- [ ] Push notifications.
- [ ] Synchronize with google calendar
- [ ] Dashboard
    - [ ] Worked hours by users
    - [ ] User performance (predicted task duration vs. effective duration)
    - [ ] Completed tasks by user
    - [ ] Users' allocation by period of time (if an user needs more hours to finish the tasks than his daily working hours, the tasks will be delayed)
- [ ] Allow users to download their data (task lists, etc).
- [ ] Security mechanisms so that users' information cannot be viewed neither by other users nor by the development team.
